1- Create Environment

In the terminal shell enter 

conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda

where yourenvname is the name you want to call your environment, and replace x.x with the Python version you wish to use. 
(
To see a list of available python versions first, type 
conda search "^python$"
)

2-Run Jupyter Notebook within the chosen environment

Open the terminal shell
Tap conda activate nombre del environment to open the chosen environment
Tap Jupyter Notebook 

3-Install additional packages to the virtual environment

Enter the command 

conda install -n yourenvname [package]

where yourenvname is the name of your environment, and [package] is the name of the package you wish to install. Failure to specify “-n yourenvname” will install the package to the root Python installation.
This will install the package from anaconda distribution, whenever available.
